This layout is meant to be played as humans only (/lock a),
without building (/disabledEquipment "ckit", or at least
disabled building stuff, even if not repairing).
Ideally, alien bots should have a dedicated behavior to be
less rushy, and spawn in a more balanced fashion.
There should be roughly 1.5 alien per human.
It is meant for maximum 4 human players.
